### Project Topic Area
I am hoping to work on the University of Cincinnati Army ROTC website and add functionality to it. I have gotten approval from the Professor of Military Science, and now I need to go through Accessibility Compliance Training and Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) training. This project will help the ROTC program recruit and maintain numbers as well as improve communication within our battalion. I have worked on website projects in the past, but Iâ€™ve never worked with an official published website. I am hoping to learn how schools and businesses update and maintain websites with many editors.

If I am not able to gain access to the University's website, I will develope a website that will behave how I would like the University of Cincinnati Army ROTC website to.
