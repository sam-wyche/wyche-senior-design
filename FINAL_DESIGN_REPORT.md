# Project Description

My project will be creating a website for the University of Cincinnati Army ROTC program. The one we currently have is a bit overwhelming and it is difficult for incoming Cadets to find the information that pertains to them, so my focus on this project is to clearly communicate the relevent information that a potential Cadet would like to know. I will do this by keeping the information simple and by making the website more dynamic so people keep reading.
